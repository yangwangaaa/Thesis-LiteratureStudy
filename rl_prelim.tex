\chapter{Reinforcement Learning Preliminaries}
This chapter is dedicated to present a concise theory of reinforcement learning. The first subsection will explain the basics of markov decision process \ac{MDP}, a general framework used for \ac{RL} problem. Subsequently, an intuition of value and policy iteration will be built in section \ref{sec:value_iter}. The third section will present the extension of  \ac{RL} for continuous space. Finally, section \ref{sec:actor} will discuss the actor-critic structure which is a natural representation for control system problem.
