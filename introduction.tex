Reference or trajectory tracking is one of the most basic task in robotics. Given a desired path/trajectory, the robot must be able to follow it as quickly as possible with minimum error. In order to achieve this, a controller is needed. However, robots are identical with non-linearities, noises, and external disturbances that are difficult to model, let alone identify. This unknown properties often hinders the controller to perform optimally.

In order to
